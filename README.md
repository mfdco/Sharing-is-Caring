# Sharing-is-Caring
This program simulates students's laptops to be Ad-Hoc wireless networks. Each student can choose whose laptops can or cannot connect to their wireless hotspot. 
Two conditions to share network from another student's hotspot : 1.) Must be linked together. 2.) Student must be within broadcast range of student's wireless hotspot.
All students will be stored in a Binary Search Tree based of thier MAC adrresses of their laptops. Each node will have several data members as well as a pointer to the head of a linked-list which represents the list of laptops that it is linked to.
